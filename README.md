## Le Mail
Write e-mail faster.

#### Project motivations
I don't like creating things that don't provide a "[quantum of utility](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=542768)". So I thought that, even with this project, I'd turn it into something that I'd actually use. 

E-mail should not take as much time as it does for most people right now. Having observed those who I consider good at e-mail, one thing I've noticed is how quickly they write and send them out. With this in mind, I created two rules for sending e-mail faster:

- the email must be written in less than 5 minutes
- you must type something at least every 10 seconds

If you don't do follow these two rules, the e-mail gets erased. These two rules act a forcing function to let you get thru e-mails faster and get back to doing whatever it is you'd rather be doing instead.

#### My background
My experience is a mix of:

- node.js (backend)
- backbone, angular (frontend)

I've definitely spent more time on the backend than on frontend, so please take note of that when looking at the frontend code.
